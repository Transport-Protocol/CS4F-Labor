Weijers has written a concise and lucid history of the disputation in Europe from antiquity to the eighteenth century, which draws on her twenty years of scholarly research focused on the medieval universities in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Weijers’s account is also admirable in its chronological and comparative breadth, and is invaluable for bringing to broader attention the full complexity of the terms, formats, and arguments involved in the disputation from the close study of many primary sources.}",

To identify major supervision challenges, survey and interviews have been conducted among current undergraduate and postgraduate students. Computer Science supervisors are also interviewed in parallel to identify their challenges. Based on the comments and feedback from both supervisors and supervises, this study proposes the integration of gamified system to facilitate the process of thesis supervision in computer science.",

abstract = {Summary The validation of academic credits and issuance of academic degree certificates in the Brazilian education system currently occurs in a semi or completely noncomputerized way. The actual digitization of this system could make it more secure and decrease bureaucracy in terms of document validation, saving in storage and labor. Due to the recent increase in forgeries and loss of records, it is paramount that this process becomes more transparent and reliable for all involved parties. This article presents a proposal and an implementation for the digitization of degree certificates and academic credits for higher education in the Brazilian education system. A transparent model based on blockchain is proposed, in which higher education institutions register students and their academic credits in a chain of records using the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure for identity management. This information, associated with smart contracts, enables the reliable and decentralized issuance of degree certificates through the validation of a historical database and the triggering of transactions using smart contracts. The focus of this article is the demonstration of an experiment that validates this proposal.},
