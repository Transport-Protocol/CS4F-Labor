	abstract = {Energy consumption of computing systems has become a major concern. Constrained by cost, environmental concerns and policy, minimising the energy foot-print of computing systems is one of the primary goals of many initiatives. As we move towards exascale computing, energy constraints become very real and are a major driver in design decisions. The issue is also apparent at the scale of desk top machines, where many core and accelerator chips are common and offer a spectrum of opportunities for balancing energy and performance. Conventionally, approaches for reducing energy consumption have been either at the operational level (such as powering down all or part of systems) or at the hardware design level (such as utilising specialised low-energy components). In this paper, we are interested in a different approach; energy-aware software. By measuring the energy consumption of a computer application and understanding where the energy usage lies, may allow a change of the software to provide opportunities for energy savings. In order to understand the complexities of this approach, we specifically look at multithreaded algorithms and applications. By an evaluation of a benchmark suite on multiple architectures and multiple environments, we show how basic parameters, such as threading options, compilers and frequencies, can impact energy consumption. As such, we provide an overview of the challenges that face software developers in this regard. We then offer a view of the directions that need to be taken and possible strategies needed for building energy-aware software.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The energy efficiency of it-related products, from the software perspective, has gained vast popularity the recent years and paved a new emerging research field. However, there is limited number of research works regarding the energy consumption of relatively small programming tasks. This knowledge is critical to be known especially in cases where millions of small tasks are running in parallel on multiple devices all around the globe. Goal: In this preliminary study, we aim to identify energy implications of small, independent tasks developed in different programming languages; compiled, semi-compiled, and interpreted ones. Method: To achieve our purpose, we collected, refined, compared, and analyzed a number of implemented tasks from Rosetta Code, that is a publicly available Repository for programming chrestomathy. Results: Our analysis shows that among compiled programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Go offer the highest energy efficiency for all of our tested tasks compared to C\#, VB.Net, and Rust. Regarding interpreted programming languages PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript exhibit the most energy savings compared to Swift, R, Perl, and Python.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Energy_proportional_computing&oldid=1166506373},
	abstract = {In computing, energy proportionality is a measure of the relationship between power consumed in a computer system, and the rate at which useful work is done (its utilization, which is one measure of performance). If the overall power consumption is proportional to the computer's utilization, then the machine is said to be energy proportional. Equivalently stated, for an idealized energy proportional computer, the overall energy per operation (a measure of energy efficiency)  is constant for all possible workloads and operating conditions. 
The concept was first proposed in 2007 by Google engineers Luiz André Barroso and Urs Hölzle, who urged computer architects to design servers that would be much more energy efficient for the datacenter setting.Energy proportional computing is currently an area of active research, and has been highlighted as an important design goal for cloud computing. There are many technical challenges remaining in the design of energy proportional computers. Furthermore, the concept of energy proportionality is not inherently restricted to computing. Although countless energy efficiency advances have been made in non-computing disciplines, they have not been evaluated rigorously in terms of their energy proportionality.},

	abstract = {Recent work has studied the effect that factors such as code obfuscation, refactorings and data types have on energy efficiency. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the energy behavior of programs written in a lazy purely functional language, Haskell. We have conducted two empirical studies to analyze the energy efficiency of Haskell programs from two different perspectives: strictness and concurrency. Our experimental space exploration comprises more than 2000 configurations and 20000 executions. We found out that small changes can make a big difference in terms of energy consumption. For example, in one of our benchmarks, under a specific configuration, choosing one data sharing primitive (MVar) over another (TMVar) can yield 60\% energy savings. In another benchmark, the latter primitive can yield up to 30\% energy savings over the former. Thus, tools that support developers in quickly refactoring a program to switch between different primitives can be of great help if energy is a concern. In addition, the relationship between energy consumption and performance is not always clear. In sequential benchmarks, high performance is an accurate proxy for low energy consumption. However, for one of our concurrent benchmarks, the variants with the best performance also exhibited the worst energy consumption. To support developers in better understanding this complex relationship, we have extended two existing performance analysis tools to also collect and present data about energy consumption.},

	abstract = {ICT hold significant potential to increase resource and energy efficiencies and contribute to a circular economy. Yet unresolved is whether the aggregated net effect of ICT overall mitigates or aggravates environmental burdens. While the savings potentials have been explored, drivers that prevent these and possible counter measures have not been researched thoroughly. The concept digital sufficiency constitutes a basis to understand how ICT can become part of the essential environmental transformation. Digital sufficiency consists of four dimensions, each suggesting a set of strategies and policy proposals: (a) hardware sufficiency, which aims for fewer devices needing to be produced and their absolute energy demand being kept to the lowest level possible to perform the desired tasks; (b) software sufficiency, which covers ensuring that data traffic and hardware utilization during application are kept as low as possible; (c) user sufficiency, which strives for users applying digital devices frugally and using ICT in a way that promotes sustainable lifestyles; and (d) economic sufficiency, which aspires to digitalization supporting a transition to an economy characterized not by economic growth as the primary goal but by sufficient production and consumption within planetary boundaries. The policies for hardware and software sufficiency are relatively easily conceivable and executable. Policies for user and economic sufficiency are politically more difficult to implement and relate strongly to policies for environmental transformation in general. This article argues for comprehensive policies for digital sufficiency, which are indispensible if ICT are to play a beneficial role in overall environmental transformation.},

The term Green computing came into existence with thelaunch of Energy Star program in 1992 by U.S environmentalprotection agency. It aims towards electricity saving and lessamount of heat generated by the computers. Widespread use ofcomputers and related IT products has a very bad effect on theenvironment. Personal Computers are bad for environmentbecause they are not biodegradable and the parts and pieceswill be around forever and are rarely recyclable. Environmentpollution could be because of the defects in manufacturingtechniques, disposal techniques for computers andcomponents. There are toxic chemicals used in themanufacturing of computers and when we use informaldisposing they put harmful impacts on our environment. So tosave our environment and to reduce the harmful impacts ofcomputers we have to aware about it. Green computing canalso develop solutions that offer benefits by aligning all ITprocesses and practices with the core principles ofsustainability, which are to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Theconcept of Green computing has begun to spread in the pastfew years, gaining increasing popularity. This research paperdescribes that today computer is an essential part of our life,No one can not to do any work without computer, but we haveto be aware about the harmful effects of computer on ourenvironment.

	abstract = {Depending on energy sources and demand, the carbon intensity of the public power grid fluctuates over time. Exploiting this variability is an important factor in reducing the emissions caused by data centers. However, regional differences in the availability of low-carbon energy sources make it hard to provide general best practices for when to consume electricity. Moreover, existing research in this domain focuses mostly on carbon-aware workload migration across geo-distributed data centers, or addresses demand response purely from the perspective of power grid stability and costs. In this paper, we examine the potential impact of shifting computational workloads towards times where the energy supply is expected to be less carbon-intensive. To this end, we identify characteristics of delay-tolerant workloads and analyze the potential for temporal workload shifting in Germany, Great Britain, France, and California over the year 2020. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate two workload shifting scenarios in a simulation to investigate the influence of time constraints, scheduling strategies, and the accuracy of carbon intensity forecasts. To accelerate research in the domain of carbon-aware computing and to support the evaluation of novel scheduling algorithms, our simulation framework and datasets are publicly available.},

	abstract = {Climate change due to increasing carbon emissions by human activities has been identified as one of the most critical threat to Earth. Carbon neutralization, as a key approach to reverse climate change, has triggered the development of new regulations to enforce the economic activities toward low carbon solutions. Computing networks that enable users to process computation-intensive tasks contribute huge amount of carbon emissions due to rising energy consumption. To analyze the achievable reduction of carbon emissions by a scheduling policy, we first propose a novel virtual queueing network model that captures communication and computing procedures in networks. To adapt to highly variable and unpredictable nature of renewable energy utilized by computing networks (i.e., carbon intensity of grid varies by time and location), we propose a novel carbon-intensity based scheduling policy that dynamically schedules computation tasks over clouds via the drift-plus-penalty methodology in Lyapunov optimization. Our numerical analysis using real-world data shows that the proposed policy achieves 54\% reduction on the cumulative carbon emissions for AI model training tasks compared to the queue-length based policy.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that datacenter computers rarely operate at full utilization, leading to a number of proposals for creating servers that are energy proportional with respect to the computation that they are performing. In this paper, we show that as servers themselves become more energy proportional, the datacenter network can become a significant fraction (up to 50\%) of cluster power. In this paper we propose several ways to design a high-performance datacenter network whose power consumption is more proportional to the amount of traffic it is moving -- that is, we propose energy proportional datacenter networks. We first show that a flattened butterfly topology itself is inherently more power efficient than the other commonly proposed topology for high-performance datacenter networks. We then exploit the characteristics of modern plesiochronous links to adjust their power and performance envelopes dynamically. Using a network simulator, driven by both synthetic workloads and production datacenter traces, we characterize and understand design tradeoffs, and demonstrate an 85\% reduction in power --- which approaches the ideal energy-proportionality of the network. Our results also demonstrate two challenges for the designers of future network switches: 1) We show that there is a significant power advantage to having independent control of each unidirectional channel comprising a network link, since many traffic patterns show very asymmetric use, and 2) system designers should work to optimize the high-speed channel designs to be more energy efficient by choosing optimal data rate and equalization technology. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate that energy proportional datacenter communication is indeed possible.},

	abstract = {Power optimization for data center networks (DCNs) has recently received increasing research attention, since a DCN can account for 10 to 20 percent of the total power consumption of a data center. An effective power-saving approach for DCNs is trafﬁc consolidation, which consolidates trafﬁc ﬂows onto a small set of links and switches such that unused network devices can be shut down dynamically for power savings. While this approach has shown great promise, existing solutions are mostly centralized and do not scale well for large-scale DCNs. In this article, we propose DISCO, a DIStributed trafﬁc ﬂow COnsolidation framework, with correlation analysis and delay constraints, for large-scale data center network. DISCO features two distributed trafﬁc consolidation algorithms that provide different trade-offs (as desired by different DCN architectures) between scalability, power savings, and network performance. First, a ﬂow-based algorithm is proposed to conduct consolidation for each ﬂow individually, with greatly improved scalability. Second, an even more scalable switch-based algorithm is proposed to consolidate ﬂows on each individual switch in a distributed fashion. We evaluate the DISCO algorithms both on a hardware testbed and in large-scale simulations with real DCN traces. The results show that, compared with state-of-the-art centralized solutions, DISCO can achieve nearly the same power savings while decomposing the global problem into sub-problems that are three orders of magnitude smaller. As a result, DISCO can run 104 to 106 times faster for a DCN at the scale of 10K servers. The convergence of DISCO has also been proven theoretically and examined experimentally.},
